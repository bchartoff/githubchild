githubchild
===========

Greasemonkey script to navigate to child commit when 'c' is pressed

First [install greasemonkey in Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

Then open the script in Firefox (file -> open -> githubchild.user.js) and install.

From any github commit page, press 'c' to navigate to the child commit. Press 'p' to navigate to the parent commit (built in github functionality).

It all runs in JS right now so it's a bit slow, but it gets the job done (there will be more slowdown for very large repos)
